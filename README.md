This repository demonstrates the implementation of **TabLayout** with **ViewPager** in an Android project using Java. It includes three fragments to show the basic usage and integration of these components. Below, you will find detailed information on what TabLayout and ViewPager are, why they are used, and how to integrate them into your project.

## What is TabLayout?
**TabLayout** is a UI component in Android that provides horizontal navigation between different pages or views. It is often used to implement tabbed navigation in mobile applications, allowing users to switch between different content sections.

### Why Use TabLayout?
- Enhances the user experience by organizing content into tabs.
- Provides a familiar and intuitive navigation pattern.
- Easy to customize and integrate with other UI components.

### Key Features of TabLayout
- Supports text and icons in tabs.
- Allows scrollable and fixed tab modes.
- Easily integrates with **ViewPager** for swipeable pages.

## What is ViewPager?
**ViewPager** is a widget in Android that allows the user to flip through pages of data using a swipe gesture. It works seamlessly with fragments to display different screens.

### Why Use ViewPager?
- Facilitates smooth swiping between different fragments or views.
- Enhances user engagement by providing a fluid and interactive UI.
- Simplifies handling multiple fragments in a single activity.

### Key Features of ViewPager
- Smooth page swiping animations.
- Lazy loading of fragments.
- Integration with **TabLayout** for tabbed navigation.
